### Part 1 - Examining Wireless Network

#### Time for Lab Completion:
1hrs, 21mins

#### Purpose of the Lab:

This lab teaches one how to analyze a network capture file containing wireless traffic.
Examine protocols, IP addresses, MAC addresses, as well as analyze other information from traffic.
Also how to extract an image from http traffic. 

#### What did you enjoy about the lab?

I enjoyed the simple and easy to follow directions.

#### What did you find most challenging about the lab?

I found reading the very tiny prints on the Display filter very challenging

Discussion Questions A
1.	What is Wireshark?
2.	Wireshark is a tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic on a network.
3.	What is a pcap file?
A PCAP (Packet Capture) file is a data file that contains network packet data captured by a packet sniffing tool. These files are used to store network traffic data that has been captured from a network interface, and they are commonly used for network analysis, troubleshooting, and forensics.
4.	What is SSID?
Service Set Identifier is a unique identifier attached to the header of packets sent over a wireless local area network (WLAN).
Discussion Questions B
1.	What is FTP?
File Transfer Protocol is a clear text protocol used to transfer files between systems.
2.	What is POP?
Post Office Protocol is an application layer Internet protocol used by local e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a TCP/IP connection.
3.	What is Telnet?
Telnet is a network protocol used to provide bidirectional interactive text-based communication over a network. It allows users to remotely access and manage a device, typically a server or network device, by connecting to its command-line interface (CLI).
Discussion Questions C
1.	What is the HTTP protocol?
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext over the internet. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and is a protocol used for communication between a web browser and a web server.
2.	What is a TCP stream?
A TCP stream is a sequence of packets exchanged between two devices typically, a server and a client over a network connection.
3.	What is a PDF file?
A PDF (Portable Document Format) file is a versatile file format created by Adobe that gives people an easy, reliable way to present and exchange documents - regardless of the software, hardware, or operating systems used by anyone who views the document.
